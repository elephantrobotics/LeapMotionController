- After LeapmotionController successfully starts, Mycobot will adjusts to initial position automatically 
- Use gestures to control MyCobot to move

### Tips：
1. If you start LeapMotionController and enter port number, it stops on the following page and you cannot control MyCobot through LeapMotion

   If the driver has been successfully installed but the version is too low, it is recommended to change to the driver provided by us
2. When controlling MyCobot with Leapmotion, Mycobot will return to initial position when the hand is out of range of Leapmotion’s detection
3. MyCobot moves in response to gesture and cannot hover in one position
